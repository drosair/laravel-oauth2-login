# Laravel OAuth2 Login

This is a Laravel5 package that provides a middleware to protect routes requiring an OAuth2 login.

You could describe it as a bridge between Laravel and [league/oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client).

## Features

* OAuth2 client middleware
* Keeps token in session
* Refreshes expired tokens
* (Cached) resource owner info
* Driver to allow use of `Auth` facade

## Fork Details
This fork will allow for additional parameters/headers to be sent in the requests to the OAuth2 server. For example, the domain attrribute for Oracle Access Manager 12c OAuth 2.0.

## Install

* Using composer: `$ composer require drosair/laravel-oauth2-login`
* Register the service provider (Auto-Discovery enabled): `Kronthto\LaravelOAuth2Login\ServiceProvider`
* Publish the config file: `$ artisan vendor:publish --provider="Kronthto\LaravelOAuth2Login\ServiceProvider"`
* Put the credentials of your OAuth Provider in the published config

## Usage

Add the `Kronthto\LaravelOAuth2Login\CheckOAuth2` middleware to the routes (-groups) you want to protect.

**Bear in mind that this only ensures that some user is logged in**, if you require further authorization checks those will still have to be implemented. This package stores the resource owner info as an Request-attribute to enable you to do so.

### `Auth` guard

This is optional, as adding the middleware redirects the client anyways if not authenticated. If you want to utilize Policies however you will need to define a custom guard. A driver for it is provided by this package.

In your auth config, add the new guard like this:
``` php
  'oauth2' => [
    'driver' => 'oauth2', // Config: oauth2login.auth_driver_key
  ]
```

**You will need to assign a higher priority to `CheckOAuth2` than `\Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate`**, do this by overriding `$middlewarePriority` in your Http-Kernel.
